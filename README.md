# StormBeans, a PhpStorm theme for human beings


This is a PhpStorm theme inspired by a [Grafikart's theme](http://www.grafikart.fr/ressources/netbeans/theme-netbeans-10) for the NetBeans IDE.

For now, only the PHP part of the theme has been ported.  
Javascript and HTML part are on the TODO-list.

6. Go to **File > Settings**
7. In the *IDE Settings* section, go to **Editor > Colors & Fonts** 
8. In the right part of the window, select `StormBeans` in the list and hit `Apply`
9. Enjoy!

## Notes


The default font used is `DejaVu Sans Mono` at size 11.  
It can be changed by modifying the [`src/colors/StormBeans.xml`](https://raw.github.com/MrMitch/StormBeans/master/src/colors/StormBeans.xml) file.  
Change the `value` attribute of the third option (with the `name` being `EDITOR_FONT_NAME`).  
For instance, let's say you are on a Microsoft Windows computer and want to use the `Consolas` font, you should edit the line like so :   

```xml
<option name="EDITOR_FONT_NAME" value="Consolas" />
```
